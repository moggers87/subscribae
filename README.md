Organise your Youtube subscriptions into something sane

The main idea is that a user can assign their subscriptions to "buckets" and
those "buckets" will get filled up with videos. For a Youtube user who is
subscribed to a large and diverse number of channels, it can be tiresome
organising videos to the point of it becoming a chore.

Eventually you give up and interesting science videos get lost between a few
gaming channels publishing their invidual perspectives on a recent multiplayer
match.

If only the auto-playlist feature allowed adding rules based on channels!
