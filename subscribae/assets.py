    """Processes CSS code using `PostCSS <http://postcss.org/>`_.

    Requires the ``postcss`` executable to be available externally.
    To install it, you might be able to do::

        $ npm install --global postcss

    You should also install the plugins you want to use::

        $ npm install --global postcss-cssnext

    You can configure postcss in ``postcss.config.js``:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        module.exports = {
            plugins: [
                require('postcss-cssnext')({
                  // optional configuration for cssnext
                })
            ],
        };

    *Supported configuration options*:

    POSTCSS_BIN
        Path to the postcss executable used to compile source files. By
        default, the filter will attempt to run ``postcss`` via the
        system path.

    POSTCSS_EXTRA_ARGS
        Additional command-line options to be passed to ``postcss`` using this
        setting, which expects a list of strings.
